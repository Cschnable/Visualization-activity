You can see from these two scatterplots how chocolate candies had a much higher average win percentage when compared to fruity candies. The win percentage is calculated by the amount of "wins" a certain type of candy had when in a matchup with another type of candy. 

```{r visuals, echo=TRUE}
candy_data <- read.csv("candy-data.csv")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = candy_data)+geom_point(mapping=aes(x=fruity,y=winpercent),color="orange")
ggplot(data = candy_data)+geom_point(mapping=aes(x=chocolate,y=winpercent),color="red")
```
